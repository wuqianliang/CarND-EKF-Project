# CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project
Self-driving Car Nanodegree Extended Kalman Filter Project

## Overview
This project implemented an Extended Kalman Filter for RADAR and LIDAR sensor data. The Udacity simulator generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object. This project implemented the Extended Kalman Filter  to fusion those measurements to predict the position and velocity of the object. 

## Prerequisites

+ cmake >= 3.5
+ make >= 4.1
+ gcc/g++ >= 5.4
+ [Udacity's simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

As described in [Udacity seed project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project), when you developed in Ubuntu 16.04, you should run [install-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/wuqianliang/CarND-EKF-Project/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh) script to install uWebsocket and other required packages.

## Basic Build Instructions
+ Clone this repo
+ cmake .
+ make (This will create ExtendedKF executable)
